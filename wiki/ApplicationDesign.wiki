#summary OSM android design and functionality.

= Introduction =

The OSM android application can be divided into several modules:
  * The reading, storing and interpretation of the binary map data
  * The map engine
  * The rendering modules
  * The rounting modules

* The reading, storing and interpretation of the binary map data 

This module handles the reading of binary data, its interpretation and storing for future access

The classes that belong to this modules are:
  * *MapItem* - represents a single item from the map, like a street, a lake, a POI, etc
  * *MapTile* - represents a collection of map item that belong to a defined area
  * *MapPresets* - every map item is identified by a numeric constant, defined in this class

* The map engine

This module handles the following tasks:
      * Manage a cache for the map tiles for fast future access
      * Selecting all the objects within a certain map region
      * Querying the database and extracting the names of the map items

The classes that belong to this modules are:
  * *CacheElement* - a generic implementation of a element within a cache
  * *Cache* - the actual implementation of a caching algorithm
  * *MapRect* - a map rectangle; a container for all map items that belong to this particular area
  * *MapEngine* - manages the caches, and the maps; it's most important task is accepting a Bounding Box and returning a MapRect object containing all the map items withing that region


* The rendering module

This module has the task of rendering to screen all the objects from a given MapRect object (a rectangular map area)

The drawing is performed using Android's OpenGL ES implementation.

It's main classes are:
  * *OsmMapRenderer* - the most important class in this modules; receives as input a MapRect objects and draws all the elements inside it
  * *GLTextures* - a helper class for managing textures
  * *LabelsTexture* - a object that represents a transparent bitmap (texture) on which street names and other text is drawn; at the end of the drawing process, this texture will be overlapped on the drawing producing the final image
